<p>The aim of the book: to produce a methodology for how to make change happen in the world.</p>

<p>Analogy of a rider on an elephant trying to move in a direction. (towards change)</p>

<p>Rider: rational brain. </p>

<p>Elephant: emotional brain.</p>

<p>To make someone change: You must reach both Rider and Elephant.</p>

<h2>Direct the Rider </h2>

<h3>Find the Bright Spots </h3>

<p>Normally: Rider has a problem-seeking mindset: &quot;What&#39;s broken, and how do we fix it?&quot;</p>

<p>Instead: Search for successful efforts, worth emulating.</p>

<p>Question: &quot;What&#39;s working and how can we do more of it?&quot;</p>

<h4>Example: </h4>

<p>&quot;Classic Therapy&quot;: </p>

<p>What are the roots of your problem? Does it trace back to something in your childhood?</p>

<p>&quot;Solutions Focused Therapy&quot;: </p>

<p>When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle, even just for a short time?</p>

<h4>Action Plan: </h4>

<p>Go investigate the most successful (villagers/ managers moments in the day).</p>

<h4>Advantages: </h4>

<ol>
	<li>Solution is usually native. Comes from the group that you are trying to help. Therefore easier to introduce. </li>
	<li>Overall topic, like &quot;What can you do to make your child healthier?&quot; is too big and loaded to take on at once. </li>
	<li>Fights &quot;Analysis Paralysis&quot; - when the rider sees problems everywhere and over-analyses. </li>
	<li>Prevents fixation on TBU information (True but Useless)</li>
	<li>Focuses on the positive. Overcomes human bias towards &quot;Bad is stronger than good&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Script the Critical Moves </h3>

<p>Give the Rider a script that explains how to act. </p>

<p>Convert your ambiguous goals into concrete behaviours.</p>

<h4>Set Behavioural Goals: </h4>

<ul>
	<li>Such as meet for a review once a week. </li>
	<li>Or never buy full fat milk.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Default Plan: </h4>

<ul>
	<li>Rider normally runs on autopilot. </li>
	<li>Following the pre-programmed habits and routines. </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision Paralysis - more options, even good ones, can freeze us and make us retreat to the default plan.</p>

<p>Thus scripting the critical moves reduces rider exhaustion. </p>

<p>More choices = More exhausted rider.</p>

<h3>Point to the Destination </h3>

<p>Create a destination postcard. </p>

<p>This is a vivid picture from the near future that shows what could be possible.</p>

<h4>Destination postcards do double duty: </h4>

<ul>
	<li>they show the rider where you&#39;re headed. </li>
	<li>they show the Elephant why the journey is worthwhile.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Problem of Rationalisation:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Where you decide to do something like to have just 1 glass of wine. </li>
	<li>Then you rationalise that surely it&#39;s okay to fill your 1 glass to the brim. Or to trade tomorrow&#39;s 1 glass to have 2 today!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Solution: Black and White Goal </h4>

<ul>
	<li>An all-or-nothing goals such as &quot;No wine ever&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s essential to marry your long-term goal with short-term critical moves.</p>

<p>Back up your destination postcard with a good behavioural script. </p>

<h2>Motivate the Elephant </h2>

<h3>Find the Feeling</h3>

<p>Find ways to help others see the problems or solutions in ways that influence emotions, not just thought.</p>

<p>Trying to fight inertia and indifference with analytical arguments is like tossing a fire extinguisher to someone who&#39;s drowning. The solution doesn&#39;t match the problem.</p>

<h4>Example of Re-Mission (a game for young Chemotherapy patients) </h4>

<p>Roxxi, the nanobot boldly defeating cancer, by taking chemotherapy and antibiotics which fuel his ray gun.</p>

<h4>Positive vs Negative emotions</h4>

<p>If you need quick and specific action, then negative emotions might help. But most of the time when change is needed, it&#39;s not a stone-in-the-shoe situation.</p>

<p>Positive emotions are designed to &quot;broaden and build&quot; our repertoire of thoughts and actions. Joy, for example, makes us want to play.</p>

<p>Interest, broadens what we want to investigate.</p>

<p>Most of the big problems we encounter are ambiguous and evolving. They don&#39;t look like burning platform situations. To solve these problems we need to encourage open minds, creativity and hope. </p>

<h3>Shrink the Change </h3>

<p>One way to motivate action: Make people feel as though they are already closer to the finish line than they might have thought.</p>

<p>Example: Don&#39;t publicly announce a charity fundraiser until you&#39;ve already got 50% of the money in the bag.</p>

<p>Look for the first two stamps to put on your team&#39;s cards. &quot;I&#39;m not a sloth. I&#39;m an exerciser!&quot;</p>

<p>Make an effort to remind people what&#39;s already been conquered. Create a sense of progress. </p>

<p>To get the Elephant off its duff you need to re-assure it that the task won&#39;t be so bad. &quot;Looks it&#39;s only 5 minutes!&quot;</p>

<p>If people are facing a daunting task and their instinct is to avoid it: You&#39;ve got to break down the task. Make the change small enough that people can&#39;t help but score a victory. </p>

<p>e.g. Do one page of writing. Pay off a single debt.</p>

<p>&quot;if some example of successful change could somehow be achieved quickly, it might be possible to use that to set other changes in motion&quot; - Celebrate every incremental victory!</p>

<p>Miracle Scale - 10 is the miracle. But what are the small milestones that are attainable and visible on the way to the eventual destination?</p>

<p>Accentuate positive. Emphasise the next goal to fulfil.</p>

<h4>Select small wins with two traits: </h4>

<ol>
	<li>They&#39;re meaningful. </li>
	<li>They&#39;re within immediate reach.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grow your People </h3>

<p>How can you make your change a matter of identity rather than of consequences?</p>

<p>When people make choices they tend to rely on one of two basic models of decision making: the consequences model or the identity model. </p>

<h4>Consequences model: </h4>

<p>Weighing the costs and benefits of our options and making the choice that maximises our satisfaction. </p>

<h4>Identity model: </h4>

<p>We ask ourselves: Who am I? What kind of situation is this? What would someone like me do in this situation?</p>

<p>This model explains the way most people vote, which contradicts our notion of the &quot;self interested voter&quot;.</p>

<p>St. Lucia Parrot Example - &quot;This parrot is ours. Nobody has them but us. We need to cherish it and look after it&quot; </p>

<p>The St. Lucians began to embrace their parrot, as though it had always been a part of their national identity.</p>

<p>When you think about the people whose behaviour needs to change, ask yourself whether they would agree with: &quot;I aspire to be the kind of person who would make this change&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;foot in the door&quot; technique - do something small to convince people they are &quot;concerned citizens&quot; before asking for something bigger.</p>

<p>Example of billboards in people&#39;s lawns study.</p>

<h4>Fixed versus Growth Mindset </h4>

<p>Fixed Mindset: belief that their abilities are basically static. </p>

<p>Growth Mindset: belief that abilities are like muscles-they can be built up with practice.</p>

<p>The growth mindset can be taught and it can change lives. </p>

<p>Failure should be seen as part of the learning process.</p>

<h2>Shape the Path </h2>

<h4>Fundamental attribution error: </h4>

<p>People have a systematic tendency to ignore the situational forces that shape other people&#39;s behaviour.</p>

<p>Most people attribute their marital problems to some deeply engrained personality characteristics of their spouse. e.g. &quot;My husband is a stubborn person&quot;</p>

<p>Shaping the path is making the journey easier. </p>

<h3>Tweak the Environment </h3>

<p>Tweaking the environment is about making the right behaviours a little bit easier and the wrong behaviours a little bit harder.</p>

<p>Example: Amazon&#39;s 1 click ordering.</p>

<p>Example 2: To lose weight, shrink your dinner ware. Use smaller plates, bowls and cups.</p>

<p>Haddon Matrix: A simple framework that provides a way to think systematically about accidents by highlighting three key periods of time.</p>

<p>Pre-event interventions - includes anything that would tend to prevent wrecks from happening: better highway lighting, anti-lock breaks.</p>

<p>Event interventions - accept that crashes will happen and ask ourselves how we can reduce the chances of injury. e.g. seat belts.</p>

<p>Post-event interventions - minimize the severity of the injuries and optimise the heath outcomes. e.g. speedy medical team.</p>

<p>Motion Study: Where you follow one person through the entire process that you are looking to change. </p>

<p>e.g. Making a purchase. Filing a complaint. Recycling an object. </p>

<h3>Build Habits </h3>

<p>One of the subtle ways in which our environment acts on us is by reinforcing (or deterring) our habits.</p>

<p>Example of the Vietnam Veterans Drug story. The change in environment (returning home) prevented the continuation of wartime drug use.</p>

<p>The good thing about habits is they allow lots of good behaviours to happen without the rider taking charge.</p>

<p>Have an &quot;action trigger&quot;: You will execute a certain action (working out) when you encounter a certain trigger (the morning).</p>

<p>Example: pre-loading decisions. Asking students to decide when they will do the essay.</p>

<h4>Tool: The humble checklist. </h4>

<p>Example of Atul Gawande&#39;s Intensive Care Unit where he used simple checklists to dramatically reduce ward deaths.</p>

<p>Lists can help people avoid blind spots in a complex environment.</p>

<h3>Rally the Herd </h3>

<p>In ambiguous situations, we all look to others for cues about how to behave.</p>

<p>We often do things because we see our peers doing them. It&#39;s not only your body-pierced teen who follows the crowd.</p>

<p>Example: Filling tip jars to send a signal about the &quot;norm&quot; of the herd.</p>

<p>Publicise the group norm: &quot;Other people are getting their work done. So what aren&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>Use &quot;free spaces&quot; - underground small scale meetings where reformers can gather and ready themselves for collective action without being observed by members of the dominant group.</p>
