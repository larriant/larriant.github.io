<h2>Part 1: Intuitions Come First, Strategic Reasoning Second </h2>

<p>Central Metaphor: The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant.</p>

<p>The rider&#39;s job is to serve the elephant.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: Where Does Morality Come From? </h3>

<p>Nativist Answer - Morality is innate.</p>

<p>Empiricist Answer - Morality comes from childhood</p>

<p>learning.</p>

<p>The Rationalist Answer - Morality is self-constructed by children on</p>

<p>the basis of their experiences with harm.</p>

<p>Kids know that harm is wrong because they hate to be harmed, and they</p>

<p>gradually come to see that it is therefore wrong to harm others, which</p>

<p>leads them to understand fairness and eventually justice. </p>

<h4>Concludes that instead:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Moral domain varies by culture.</li>
	<li>People have gut feelings - particularly about disgust and</li>
</ul>

<p> disrespect- that drive their reasoning.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Moral reasoning is sometimes a post hock fabrication.</li>
	<li>Morality can&#39;t be entirely self-constructed by children based on</li>
</ul>

<p> their growing understanding of harm.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cultural learning or guidance must play a larger role than rationalist</li>
</ul>

<p> theories had given it.</p>

<p>Morality can be innate (as a set of evolved intuitions) and learned</p>

<p>(as children learn to apply those intuitions within a particular</p>

<p>culture)</p>

<p>We&#39;re born to be righteous, but we have to learn what, exactly, people</p>

<p>like us should be righteous about. </p>

<h3>Chapter 2: The Intuitive Dog and Its Rational Tail </h3>

<p>People reason and people have moral intuitions but what is the</p>

<p>relationship among these processes?</p>

<p>Plato - Reason could and should be the master. </p>

<p>Jefferson - Two processes equal partners. </p>

<p>Head and Heart ruling a divided empire.</p>

<p>Hume - Reason the servant of the passions.</p>

<p>Haidt things that that Hume is right.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mind divided into two parts: rider (controlled processes) and an</li>
</ul>

<p> elephant (automatic processes)</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Rider evolved to serve the elephant.</li>
	<li>Rider serving elephant can be seen when people are morally</li>
</ul>

<p> dumbfounded.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Strong gut feelings but struggle to construct post hoc

		<p>justifications for feelings.</p></li>
	<li>Social Intuitionist Model - Starts with Hume&#39;s model but makes it</li>
</ul>

<p> more social.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Moral Reasoning is part of our life-long struggle to win friends

		<p>and influence people.</p></li>
	<li>Moral Reasoning not done alone. And not to figure out the truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to change someone&#39;s mind about a moral or political issue. Talk to the elephant first.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3: Elephants Rule </h3>

<p>Evidence to Support: Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning</p>

<p>second.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brains evaluate instantly and constantly (Wundt and Zajonc).</li>
	<li>Social and political judgements depend heavily on quick intuitive</li>
</ul>

<p> flashes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our bodily states sometimes influence our moral judgements. Bad</li>
</ul>

<p> smells and tastes can make people more judgemental.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Psychopaths reason but don&#39;t feel (and are severely morally</li>
</ul>

<p> deficient).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Babies feel but don&#39;t reason (and have the beginnings of morality).</li>
	<li>Affective reactions are in the right place at the right time in the</li>
</ul>

<p> brain.</p>

<p>Intuitions can be shaped by reasoning. Especially when reasons are</p>

<p>embedded in a friendly conversation or an emotionally compelling</p>

<p>novel, movie or news story.</p>

<p>When we see or hear things other people do, the elephant beings to</p>

<p>lean immediately. The rider, who is always trying to anticipate the</p>

<p>elephant&#39;s next move, begins looking around for a way to support such</p>

<p>a move.</p>

<h4>Haidt&#39;s Example: </h4>

<ol>
	<li>Wife reprimanded him for leaving dirty dishes on the counter.</li>
	<li>Honestly believed that he was innocent.</li>
	<li>Immediately sent reasoning forth to defend him.</li>
	<li>It came back with an effective legal brief in 3 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Chapter 4: Vote for Me (Here&#39;s Why) </h3>

<p>Moral thinking is more like a candidate searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth.</p>

<ul>
	<li>We are obsessively concerned about what others think of us, although</li>
</ul>

<p> much of the concern is unconscious and invisible to us.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Conscious reasoning functions like a press secretary who</li>
</ul>

<p> automatically justifies any position taken by the president.</p>

<ul>
	<li>With the help of our press secretary, we are able to lie and cheat</li>
</ul>

<p> often, and then cover it up so effectively that we convince even</p>

<p> ourselves.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reasoning can take us to almost any conclusion we want to reach.</li>
	<li>In moral and political matters we are often groupish, rather than</li>
</ul>

<p> selfish.</p>

<ul>
	<li>We deploy our reasoning skills to support our team, and to</li>
</ul>

<p> demonstrate commitment to our team.</p>

<p>The worship of reason, which is sometimes found in philosophical and</p>

<p>scientific circles, is a delusion. It is an example of faith in</p>

<p>something that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Urges a more intuitionist approach to morality and moral education.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be more humble about the abilities of individuals.</li>
	<li>More attuned to the context and social systems that enable people to</li>
</ul>

<p> think and act well. (e.g. science)</p>

<h2>Part 2: There&#39;s More to Morality than Harm and Fairness </h2>

<p>Central Metaphor: The righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors. </p>

<h3>Chapter 5: Beyond WEIRD Morality </h3>

<p>People who grow up in Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich and</p>

<p>Democratic (WEIRD) societies are statistical outliers.</p>

<p>The WEIRDer you are, the more you perceive a world full of separate</p>

<p>objects rather than relationships.</p>

<p>Moral pluralism is true descriptively. The moral domain varies across</p>

<p>cultures.</p>

<p>Moral domain unusually narrow in WEIRD cultures. Where it is limited</p>

<p>to ethics of autonomy (i.e. individuals oppressing each other)</p>

<p>Moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence,</p>

<p>or even existence, of other matrices.</p>

<p>A small set of innate and universal moral foundations can be used to</p>

<p>construct a great variety of moral matrices. </p>

<h3>Chapter 6: Taste Buds of the Righteous Mind</h3>

<p>Morality is like taste in many ways.</p>

<p>Deontology and utilitarianism are &quot;one-receptor&quot; moralities that are likely to appeal most strongly to people who are high on systematizing</p>

<p>and low on empathizing.</p>

<p>Hume&#39;s pluralist, sentimentalist and naturalist approach to ethics.</p>

<p>Five good candidates for taste receptors: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Care </li>
	<li>Fairness </li>
	<li>Loyalty </li>
	<li>Authority </li>
	<li>Sanctity </li>
</ol>

<h3>Chapter 7: The Moral Foundations of Politics </h3>

<p>Defines innateness as &quot;organized in advance of experience&quot; - like the first draft of</p>

<p>a book. Revised as individuals grow up within diverse cultures.</p>

<h4>The Care/harm foundation </h4>

<ul>
	<li>Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of caring for

		<p>vulnerable children.</p></li>
	<li>Makes us sensitive to signs of suffering and need. It makes us

		<p>despise cruelty and want to care for those who are suffering.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Fairness/cheating foundation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of reaping the

		<p>rewards of co-operation without being exploited.</p></li>
	<li>Makes us sensitive to indications that another person is likely to

		<p>be a good/bad partner for collaboration or reciprocal altruism.</p></li>
	<li>Makes us want to punish or shun cheaters.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Loyalty/betrayal foundation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forming and

		<p>maintaining coalitions. </p></li>
	<li>Makes us sensitive to signs that another person is (or is not)

		<p>a team player.</p></li>
	<li>We trust and reward such people. But want to hurt those who betray

		<p>us or our group.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Sanctity/degradation foundation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of the omnivore&#39;s

		<p>dilemma.</p></li>
	<li>Then to the broader challenge of living in a world of pathogens

		<p>and parasites.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The left relies primarily on care and fairness foundations. Whereas</p>

<p>the right uses all five.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8: The Conservative Advantage</h3>

<p>Republicans understand the social intuitionist model better than do</p>

<p>Democrats. Republicans speak more directly to the elephant.</p>

<p>Durkheimian vision of society. In which the basic social unit is the</p>

<p>family, rather than the individual. And in which order, hierarchy and</p>

<p>tradition are heavily valued.</p>

<p>Contrasted with the liberal Millian vision, which is more open and</p>

<p>individualistic.</p>

<p>Revisions to Moral Foundations Theory to do a better job of explaining</p>

<p>intuitions about liberty and fairness.</p>

<h4>Adds the Liberty/oppression foundation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Makes people notice and resent any sign of attempted domination.</li>
	<li>Triggers an urge to band together to resist or overthrow bullies

		<p>and tyrants.</p></li>
	<li>Supports Both the egalitarianism/anti-authoritarianism of the left

		<p>AND give-me-liberty conservatives.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Modifies Fairness foundation to focus more strongly on</p>

<p>proportionality.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Most people have a deep intuitive concern for the law of karma. </li>
</ul>

<p>Democrats often say that Republicans have duped these people into</p>

<p>voting against their economic self-interest. But in fact they are</p>

<p>voting for their <em>moral interests</em>.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want their nation to devote itself primarily to the care of</p>

<p>victims and the pursuit of social justice.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Morality Binds and Blinds </h2>

<p>Central Metaphor - We are 90% Chimp and 10% Bee.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9: Why are we So Groupish? </h3>

<p>Darwin believed that morality was an adaption that evolved by natural</p>

<p>selection operating at the individual level AND at the group level.</p>

<p>Tribes with more virtuous members replaced tribes with more selfish</p>

<p>members.</p>

<p>But idea banished with argument that the free rider problem dooms</p>

<p>group selection. Seemingly altruistic acts had to be explained as</p>

<p>covert forms of selfishness.</p>

<p>But actually: natural selection works at multiple levels</p>

<p>simultaneously.</p>

<p>Multi-level selection would go a long way to explaining why people are</p>

<p>simultaneously so selfish and so groupish.</p>

<h4>Four arguments: </h4>

<h5>1. Major transitions produce super organisms.</h5>

<ul>
	<li>History of Life on Earth shows repeated examples of &quot;major</li>
</ul>

<p> transitions&quot;.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free rider problem muted at one level of the biological hierarchy,</li>
</ul>

<p> larger and more powerful vehicles arise at the next level up.</p>

<h5>2. Shared intentionality generates moral matrices</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Rubicon crossing that let our ancestors function so well in groups</li>
</ul>

<p> was the ability to share intentions and other mental</p>

<p> representations.</p>

<h5>3. Genes and cultures co-evolve.</h5>

<ul>
	<li>People created new customs, norms and intuitions that altered the</li>
</ul>

<p> degree to which many groupish traits were adaptive.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gene-culture co-evolution gave us a set of tribal instincts: we love</li>
</ul>

<p> to mark group membership.</p>

<h5>4. Evolution can be fast.</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Human evolution did not stop or slow down 50,000 years ago. It sped</li>
</ul>

<p> up.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gene-culture co-evolution reached a fever pitch during the last</li>
</ul>

<p> 12,000 years.</p>

<p>Haidt still argues that <em>most</em> of human nature was shaped by natural selection operating at the</p>

<p>level of the individual. Most - but not all. </p>

<h3>Chapter 10: The Hive Switch </h3>

<p>When Haidt started writing The Happiness Hypothesis (his first book): he thought happiness</p>

<p>came from within. As Buddha and the Stoic philosophers said thousands</p>

<p>of years ago.</p>

<p>But by the time he had finished writing he realized that happiness comes from between. </p>

<p>It comes from getting the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, and</p>

<p>yourself and something larger than yourself.</p>

<p>We evolved to live in groups. Our minds are designed not only to help</p>

<p>us win the competition within our groups but also to help us unite to</p>

<p>win competitions against other groups.</p>

<p><strong>Hive hypothesis:</strong> Human beings are conditional hive creatures.</p>

<p>We have the ability (under certain circumstances) to transcend</p>

<p>self-interest and lose ourselves (temporarily and ecstatically) in</p>

<p>something larger than ourselves. </p>

<p>This ability is the <em>Hive Switch</em>.</p>

<p>Another way of stating Durkheim&#39;s idea that we are <em>Homo Duplex</em>. We</p>

<p>live most of our lives in the ordinary (profane) world, but we achieve</p>

<p>our greatest joys in those brief moments of transit to the sacred</p>

<p>work. In which we become &quot;simply a part of the whole&quot;.</p>

<p>Three common ways the hive switch is flipped: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Awe in nature </li>
	<li>Durkheimian drugs </li>
	<li>Raves </li>
</ol>

<p>Oxytocin and Mirror neurons are the stuff of which the hive switch is</p>

<p>made:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Oxytocin - &quot;cuddle hormone&quot; - bonds people to their groups.</li>
	<li>Mirror Neurons - Helps people empathise with others but</li>
</ol>

<p> particularly those that share their moral matrix.</p>

<p>We are not designed to love everybody. Just parochial love -love within</p>

<p>groups- amplified by similarity, a sense of shared fate and the</p>

<p>suppression of free riders. </p>

<h3>Chapter 11: Religion is a Team Sport </h3>

<p>If you think about religions as a set of beliefs about supernatural</p>

<p>agents, you&#39;re bound to misunderstand it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see those beliefs as foolish delusions, perhaps even</p>

<p>s parasites that exploit our brains for their own benefit.</p>

<p>But if you take a Durkheimian approach to religion (focusing on</p>

<p>belonging) and a Darwinian approach to morality (involving multilevel</p>

<p>selection), you get a very different picture.</p>

<p>Religious practices have been binding our ancestors into groups for</p>

<p>tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p>That binding involves some blinding when a person, book or principle</p>

<p>is declared sacred.</p>

<p>Our ability to believe in supernatural agents from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>hypersensitive agency detection device - we find agents everywhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>But groups that used them to construct moral communities were the ones</p>

<p>that lasted and prospered. They used their gods to elicit sacrifice</p>

<p>and commitment from members. Helped to suppress cheating and increase</p>

<p>trustworthiness within the group.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12: Can&#39;t We All Disagree More Constructively? </h3>

<p>People don&#39;t adopt their ideologies at random, or by soaking up whatever</p>

<p>ideas are around them.</p>

<p>People whose genes gave them brains that get a special pleasure from</p>

<p>novelty, variety and diversity while simultaneously being less</p>

<p>sensitive to signs of threat are predisposed (but not predestined) to</p>

<p>become liberals.</p>

<p>They tend to develop certain &quot;characteristic adaptations&quot; and &quot;life</p>

<p>narratives&quot; that make them resonate with the left narrative.</p>

<p>Once people join a political team, they are ensnared in its moral</p>

<p>matrix. They see confirmation of their grand narrative everywhere.</p>

<p>Liberals might have more difficulty understanding conservatives that</p>

<p>the other way round because of their limited moral matrices.</p>

<p>Liberals often have more difficulty seeing moral capital. Which he</p>

<p>defines as the resources that sustain a moral community.</p>

<p>Liberals and conservatives are like yin and yang. Both are necessary</p>

<p>elements of a healthy state of political life. </p>

<p>Liberals are experts in care. They are better able to see the victims</p>

<p>of existing social arrangements and they continually push to update</p>

<p>those arrangements and invent new ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?&quot; - Robert F.</p>

<p>Kennedy</p>

<p>Liberals make two points profoundly important for the health of</p>

<p>a society: </p>

<ol>
	<li>governments can and should restrain corporate super organisms.</li>
	<li>some big problems can be solved by regulation</li>
</ol>

<p>Libertarians are right that markets are miraculous (at least when their</p>

<p>externalities and other failures can be addressed.)</p>

<p>Social conservatives are right that you don&#39;t help the bees by</p>

<p>destroying the hive.</p>

<p>Increasing Manichaeism of American political life. (More War less</p>

<p>co-operation)</p>

<p>Morality binds and blinds.</p>

<p>It binds us into ideological teams that fight each other as though the</p>

<p>fate of the world depended on our side winning each battle.</p>

<p>It blinds us to the fact that each team is composed of good people who</p>

<p>have something important to say.</p>
