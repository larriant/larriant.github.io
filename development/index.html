<h2>Previous Projects</h2> 
<h3>NearSt</h3>
<img src="../public/nearst.png" height="200px">
<p><a href="http://ww.near.st">NearSt</a> is a startup dedicated to getting people back to the high street. They aim to make it faster and easier for shoppers to buy from high street stores than order online.</p>

<p>I worked for NearSt as a full stack engineer from Nov 2016 until Jan 2018.</p>

<p>During this time I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Led the XP Team that built NearSt's consumer websites and apps.</li>
  <li>Incrementally rebuilt the entire front end architecture in React whilst maintaining the legacy website's uptime.</li>
  <li>Introduced GraphQL to the company and helped setup a microservices architecture.</li>
  <li>Described by the CEO as a "learning and doing machine"</li>
</ul>
<h3>LOVESPACE</h3>
<img src="../public/lovespace.jpg" height="200px">
<p><a href="http://www.lovespace.co.uk">LOVESPACE</a> is the UKs largest by-the-box storage startup aiming to disrupt the self-storage industry.</p>

<p>I worked for LOVESPACE as an engineer in 2015.</p>

<p>During this time I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Worked on transitioning the code base towards a microservices approach.</li>
  <li>Built a Restful API using C# and ASP.net for an Android Application.</li>

<h3>The News Explained</h3>
<img src="../public/tne.png" height="200px">
<p>Also in 2015, I cofounded <a href="http://www.thenewsexplained.com">The News Explained</a> with <a href="http://www.tommcgivan.com">Tom McGivan</a>. TNE is a collection of articles to help the general public understand the complex subjects of the modern world. This combined my love for current affairs (I studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at University) with Web Design and Development. </p>

<p>This project really shows off my web design skills. But it also required some programming in PHP and creation of a wordpress theme.</p>

<h3>Tzundoku</h3>
<p>Tzundoku was an idea I had at university to create a website where users could create lists of their favourite things.</p>

<p>For example: "Top 10 Matt Damon Films" or "Top 10 Barbers in London". </p>

<ul>
  <li>Created using Flask (a really great, lightweight python framework) </li>
  <li>Learnt how to run a LAMP stack and do Continuous Integration with Jekyll</li>
  </ul>

<p>The code for this project can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/larriant/tzundokuo">here</a>
  
<h3>Project Anmo</h3>
<p>Project Anmo is a fun project I developed with a friend to learn Ruby on Rails. It started as a simple todo list. But then we added an algorithm in C (for performance) to "auto generate" the list.</p>

<p>The code for this project is also on github <a href="https://github.com/larriant/project-anmo">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Other Work</h3>
<p>Contracted to build a website for <a href="http://www.manxbiodiversity.org">Manx Biodiversity</a> in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.julyandavey.com">julyandavey.com</a> is built by me using Ruby and a static site generator called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>.</p>
