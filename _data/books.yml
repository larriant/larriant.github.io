  Summary: "Great introduction to Alderian Psychology! Adler was one of the 'three giants' of 19th century psychology with Freud and Jung. This is told through a series of conversations between a philosopher and student which makes it hard to put down. Lots of counter intuitive wisdom!"

  Summary: "Jonathan Haidt argues that we all have hard-wired moral intuitions that determine our religious and political allegiances. He believes that these moral instincts evolved to help us form communities and compete with other groups. This is only one side of an ongoing debate but it is still very interesting. Especially the later stuff about the 'hive switch'!"

  Summary: "This book has got me thinking like no other! It's the combination of two big ideas. First is that to solve the pressing problems of humanity we need to move towards a Welfare State 2.0 which is called The Listening Society. Second is the ideology that's going to get us there: metamodernism. The book is written in a 'metamodern' style. For example the author (who apparently is a creation) often combines being provocative, offensive and ironic whilst at the same time being totally serious about the fate of planet earth and the human race. A must read!"

Frank Ostaseski founded the Zen Hospice Project in California where he worked with the dying for over 30 years. From these experiences he has 'five invitations' for how we can use death to live better lives. A great book on how minfullness and compassion really apply to everyday living beings."
