  Summary: "Great introduction to Adlerian Psychology! Adler was one of the 'three giants' of 19th century psychology with Freud and Jung. This is told through a series of conversations between a philosopher and student which makes it hard to put down. Lots of counter intuitive wisdom!"

  Summary: "Jonathan Haidt argues that we all have hard-wired moral intuitions that determine our religious and political allegiances. He believes that these moral instincts evolved to help us form communities and compete with other groups. This is only one side of an ongoing debate but it is still very interesting. Especially the later stuff about the 'hive switch'!"

  Summary: "This book gave me the belief that we can confront the world's problems with a positive mindset. If we can get enough people to think: What can I do to help humanity's situation? then maybe we have a chance. Big inspiration but doesn't lose track of the bigger picture and structural nature of our problems."

  Summary: "This book has got me thinking like no other! It's the combination of two big ideas. First is that to solve the pressing problems of humanity we need to move towards a Welfare State 2.0 which is called The Listening Society. Second is the ideology that's going to get us there: metamodernism. The book is written in a 'metamodern' style. For example the author (who apparently is a creation) often combines being provocative, offensive and ironic whilst at the same time being totally serious about the fate of planet earth and the human race. A must read!"

He argues we need to re-mystify and sanctify nature in order to begin to respect it once again."

  Summary: "A book filled with wisdom and insight into the nature of conflict. Argues that when we come into conflict with someone we put ourselves into a box that stops us seeing the other in their full humanity. An example is the 'Better Than' box which makes us think we are better than the other. Escaping these boxes and returning ourselves to a 'Heart at Peace' is what the book teaches."
