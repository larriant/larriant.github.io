  Summary: "Great introduction to Alderian Psychology! Adler was one of the 'three giants' of 19th century psychology with Freud and Jung. This is told through a series of conversations between a philosopher and student which makes it hard to put down. Lots of counter intuitive wisdom!"

  Summary: "Jonathan Haidt argues that we all have hard-wired moral intuitions that determine our religious and political allegiances. He believes that these moral instincts evolved to help us form communities and compete with other groups. This is only one side of an ongoing debate but it is still very interesting. Especially the later stuff about the 'hive switch'!"
