---

*Here's some more book notes where Jonathan Haidt attempts to explain
our moral, religious and political intuitions.* 

![The Righteous Mind Cover]({{ site.url }}/public/therighteousmind.jpg){:class="book-images"}

## Part 1: Intuitions Come First, Strategic Reasoning Second 
Central Metaphor: The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant.

The rider's job is to serve the elephant.

### Chapter 1: Where Does Morality Come From?  

Nativist Answer - Morality is innate.

Empiricist Answer - Morality comes from childhood
learning.

The Rationalist Answer - Morality is self-constructed by children on
the basis of their experiences with harm.

Kids know that harm is wrong because they hate to be harmed, and they
gradually come to see that it is therefore wrong to harm others, which
leads them to understand fairness and eventually justice. 

#### Concludes that instead:
+ Moral domain varies by culture.

+ People have gut feelings - particularly about disgust and
  disrespect- that drive their reasoning.
    
+ Moral reasoning is sometimes a post hock fabrication.

+ Morality can't be entirely self-constructed by children based on
  their growing understanding of harm.

+ Cultural learning or guidance must play a larger role than rationalist
  theories had given it.

Morality can be innate (as a set of evolved intuitions) and learned
(as children learn to apply those intuitions within a particular
culture)

We're born to be righteous, but we have to learn what, exactly, people
like us should be righteous about.  

### Chapter 2: The Intuitive Dog and Its Rational Tail 
People reason and people have moral intuitions but what is the
relationship among these processes?

Plato - Reason could and should be the master.  

Jefferson - Two processes equal partners. 

Head and Heart ruling a divided empire.

Hume - Reason the servant of the passions.

Haidt things that that Hume is right.

+ Mind divided into two parts: rider (controlled processes) and an
  elephant (automatic processes)
  + The Rider evolved to serve the elephant.


+ Rider serving elephant can be seen when people are morally
  dumbfounded.
  + Strong gut feelings but struggle to construct post hoc
    justifications for feelings.


+ Social Intuitionist Model - Starts with Hume's model but makes it
  more social.
  + Moral Reasoning is part of our life-long struggle to win friends
    and influence people.
  + Moral Reasoning not done alone. And not to figure out the truth.


If you want to change someone's mind about a moral or political issue. Talk to the elephant first.

### Chapter 3: Elephants Rule 
Evidence to Support: Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning
second.

+ Brains evaluate instantly and constantly (Wundt and Zajonc).

+ Social and political judgements depend heavily on quick intuitive
  flashes.
  
+ Our bodily states sometimes influence our moral judgements. Bad
  smells and tastes can make people more judgemental.
  
+ Psychopaths reason but don't feel (and are severely morally
  deficient).
  
+ Babies feel but don't reason (and have the beginnings of morality).
 
+ Affective reactions are in the right place at the right time in the
  brain.

Intuitions can be shaped by reasoning. Especially when reasons are
embedded in a friendly conversation or an emotionally compelling
novel, movie or news story.

When we see or hear things other people do, the elephant beings to
lean immediately.  The rider, who is always trying to anticipate the
elephant's next move, begins looking around for a way to support such
a move.

#### Haidt's Example: 

1. Wife reprimanded him for leaving dirty dishes on the counter.
2. Honestly believed that he was innocent.
3. Immediately sent reasoning forth to defend him.
4. It came back with an effective legal brief in 3 seconds.

### Chapter 4: Vote for Me (Here's Why) 
Moral thinking is more like a candidate searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth.

+ We are obsessively concerned about what others think of us, although
  much of the concern is unconscious and invisible to us.
  
+ Conscious reasoning functions like a press secretary who
  automatically justifies any position taken by the president.
  
+ With the help of our press secretary, we are able to lie and cheat
  often, and then cover it up so effectively that we convince even
  ourselves.
  
+ Reasoning can take us to almost any conclusion we want to reach.

+ In moral and political matters we are often groupish, rather than
  selfish.
  
+ We deploy our reasoning skills to support our team, and to
  demonstrate commitment to our team.

The worship of reason, which is sometimes found in philosophical and
scientific circles, is a delusion.  It is an example of faith in
something that doesn't exist.

Urges a more intuitionist approach to morality and moral education.
+ Be more humble about the abilities of individuals.

+ More attuned to the context and social systems that enable people to
  think and act well. (e.g. science)

## Part 2: There's More to Morality than Harm and Fairness 
Central Metaphor: The righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors.  

### Chapter 5: Beyond WEIRD Morality 
People who grow up in Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich and
Democratic (WEIRD) societies are statistical outliers.

The WEIRDer you are, the more you perceive a world full of separate
objects rather than relationships.

Moral pluralism is true descriptively. The moral domain varies across
cultures.

Moral domain unusually narrow in WEIRD cultures. Where it is limited
to ethics of autonomy (i.e. individuals oppressing each other)

Moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence,
or even existence, of other matrices.

A small set of innate and universal moral foundations can be used to
construct a great variety of moral matrices.  

### Chapter 6: Taste Buds of the Righteous Mind
Morality is like taste in many ways.

Deontology and utilitarianism are "one-receptor" moralities that are likely to appeal most strongly to people who are high on systematizing
and low on empathizing.

Hume's pluralist, sentimentalist and naturalist approach to ethics.

Five good candidates for taste receptors:  
1. Care  
2. Fairness  
3. Loyalty   
4. Authority  
5. Sanctity  

### Chapter 7: The Moral Foundations of Politics 

Defines innateness as "organized in advance of experience" - like the first draft of
a book.  Revised as individuals grow up within diverse cultures.

#### The Care/harm foundation 
  + Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of caring for
    vulnerable children.
    
  + Makes us sensitive to signs of suffering and need. It makes us
    despise cruelty and want to care for those who are suffering.

#### Fairness/cheating foundation
  + Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of reaping the
    rewards of co-operation without being exploited.
    
  + Makes us sensitive to indications that another person is likely to
    be a good/bad partner for collaboration or reciprocal altruism.
    
  + Makes us want to punish or shun cheaters.

#### Loyalty/betrayal foundation
  + Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forming and
    maintaining coalitions. 
    
  + Makes us sensitive to signs that another person is (or is not)
    a team player.
    
  + We trust and reward such people. But want to hurt those who betray
    us or our group.
    
#### Sanctity/degradation foundation
  + Evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of the omnivore's
    dilemma.
    
  + Then to the broader challenge of living in a world of pathogens
    and parasites.

The left relies primarily on care and fairness foundations. Whereas
the right uses all five.

### Chapter 8: The Conservative Advantage
Republicans understand the social intuitionist model better than do
Democrats.  Republicans speak more directly to the elephant.

Durkheimian vision of society.  In which the basic social unit is the
family, rather than the individual.  And in which order, hierarchy and
tradition are heavily valued.

Contrasted with the liberal Millian vision, which is more open and
individualistic.

Revisions to Moral Foundations Theory to do a better job of explaining
intuitions about liberty and fairness.

#### Adds the Liberty/oppression foundation

  + Makes people notice and resent any sign of attempted domination.

  + Triggers an urge to band together to resist or overthrow bullies
    and tyrants.
    
  + Supports Both the egalitarianism/anti-authoritarianism of the left
    AND give-me-liberty conservatives.

Modifies Fairness foundation to focus more strongly on
proportionality.
+ Most people have a deep intuitive concern for the law of karma. 

Democrats often say that Republicans have duped these people into
voting against their economic self-interest.  But in fact they are
voting for their *moral interests*.

They don't want their nation to devote itself primarily to the care of
victims and the pursuit of social justice.

## Part 3: Morality Binds and Blinds 
Central Metaphor - We are 90% Chimp and 10% Bee.

### Chapter 9: Why are we So Groupish?  
Darwin believed that morality was an adaption that evolved by natural
selection operating at the individual level AND at the group level.

Tribes with more virtuous members replaced tribes with more selfish
members.

But idea banished with argument that the free rider problem dooms
group selection. Seemingly altruistic acts had to be explained as
covert forms of selfishness.

But actually: natural selection works at multiple levels
simultaneously.

Multi-level selection would go a long way to explaining why people are
simultaneously so selfish and so groupish.

#### Four arguments:   

##### 1. Major transitions produce super organisms.
+ History of Life on Earth shows repeated examples of "major
  transitions".
  
+ Free rider problem muted at one level of the biological hierarchy,
  larger and more powerful vehicles arise at the next level up.

##### 2. Shared intentionality generates moral matrices
+ Rubicon crossing that let our ancestors function so well in groups
  was the ability to share intentions and other mental
  representations.

##### 3. Genes and cultures co-evolve.
+ People created new customs, norms and intuitions that altered the
  degree to which many groupish traits were adaptive.
  
+ Gene-culture co-evolution gave us a set of tribal instincts: we love
  to mark group membership.

##### 4. Evolution can be fast.
+ Human evolution did not stop or slow down 50,000 years ago. It sped
  up.
  
+ Gene-culture co-evolution reached a fever pitch during the last
  12,000 years.

Haidt still argues that *most* of human nature was shaped by natural selection operating at the
level of the individual. Most - but not all.  

### Chapter 10: The Hive Switch 
When Haidt started writing The Happiness Hypothesis (his first book): he thought happiness
came from within. As Buddha and the Stoic philosophers said thousands
of years ago.

But by the time he had finished writing he realized that happiness comes from between. 
It comes from getting the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, and
yourself and something larger than yourself.

We evolved to live in groups. Our minds are designed not only to help
us win the competition within our groups but also to help us unite to
win competitions against other groups.

**Hive hypothesis:** Human beings are conditional hive creatures.

We have the ability (under certain circumstances) to transcend
self-interest and lose ourselves (temporarily and ecstatically) in
something larger than ourselves. 

This ability is the *Hive Switch*.

Another way of stating Durkheim's idea that we are *Homo Duplex*. We
live most of our lives in the ordinary (profane) world, but we achieve
our greatest joys in those brief moments of transit to the sacred
work. In which we become "simply a part of the whole".

Three common ways the hive switch is flipped:  
1. Awe in nature  
2. Durkheimian drugs   
3. Raves  

Oxytocin and Mirror neurons are the stuff of which the hive switch is
made:

1. Oxytocin - "cuddle hormone" - bonds people to their groups.

2. Mirror Neurons - Helps people empathise with others but
   particularly those that share their moral matrix.

We are not designed to love everybody. Just parochial love -love within
groups- amplified by similarity, a sense of shared fate and the
suppression of free riders.  

### Chapter 11: Religion is a Team Sport 
If you think about religions as a set of beliefs about supernatural
agents, you're bound to misunderstand it.

You'll see those beliefs as foolish delusions, perhaps even
s parasites that exploit our brains for their own benefit.

But if you take a Durkheimian approach to religion (focusing on
belonging) and a Darwinian approach to morality (involving multilevel
selection), you get a very different picture.

Religious practices have been binding our ancestors into groups for
tens of thousands of years.

That binding involves some blinding when a person, book or principle
is declared sacred.

Our ability to believe in supernatural agents from:
+ hypersensitive agency detection device - we find agents everywhere.

But groups that used them to construct moral communities were the ones
that lasted and prospered.  They used their gods to elicit sacrifice
and commitment from members.  Helped to suppress cheating and increase
trustworthiness within the group.

### Chapter 12: Can't We All Disagree More Constructively?  
People don't adopt their ideologies at random, or by soaking up whatever
ideas are around them.

People whose genes gave them brains that get a special pleasure from
novelty, variety and diversity while simultaneously being less
sensitive to signs of threat are predisposed (but not predestined) to
become liberals.

They tend to develop certain "characteristic adaptations" and "life
narratives" that make them resonate with the left narrative.

Once people join a political team, they are ensnared in its moral
matrix. They see confirmation of their grand narrative everywhere.

Liberals might have more difficulty understanding conservatives that
the other way round because of their limited moral matrices.

Liberals often have more difficulty seeing moral capital. Which he
defines as the resources that sustain a moral community.

Liberals and conservatives are like yin and yang. Both are necessary
elements of a healthy state of political life. 

Liberals are experts in care. They are better able to see the victims
of existing social arrangements and they continually push to update
those arrangements and invent new ones.


> "There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why?
> I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?"
> - Robert F. Kennedy 

Liberals make two points profoundly important for the health of
a society: 
1. governments can and should restrain corporate super organisms.
2. some big problems can be solved by regulation

Libertarians are right that markets are miraculous (at least when their
externalities and other failures can be addressed.)

Social conservatives are right that you don't help the bees by
destroying the hive.

Increasing Manichaeism of American political life. (More War less
co-operation)

Morality binds and blinds.

It binds us into ideological teams that fight each other as though the
fate of the world depended on our side winning each battle.

It blinds us to the fact that each team is composed of good people who
have something important to say.
