## Introduction
In the last few years I have been developing a Philosophy of Life that I want to outline today. 

But what exactly is a Philosophy of Life?

It's an approach to existence. A way of being. An answer to the existential question. A musing on the human condition. 

It is the attitude I would like to take on the good days and the bad.

But more fundamentally it is a feeling that I would like to foster in my life.

This post is a reminder to myself of all this. About how I feel about life on my best of days. 

Maybe I will try to describe the sensation:

>The rain's falling on my face. I love it. The winds almost painful. Great. Dark Side of the Moon. Thumping Heart Beats. I feel like a sponge absorbing existence. The universe is pouring into me. 

I don't think it's possible to feel this way all of the time. The peaks of existence are naturally fleeting moments.

But I think it is getting harder and harder to feel this way. Every day we are bombarded with news stories of pain and suffering. We come to believe that the world is inherently a bad place. Not something worthy of enjoyment in itself. 

This post is my battle against this view of existence. My enemy: a life of apathy. 

This battle comes in the form of a series of choices about how we view the world. There is a choice about how we deal with the fact that we will die. Another choice is about how we deal with problems. And a choice of how we look over the objects before us. My answer to these choices has no more truth than another. But I think these answers suggest a better way to view existence.

## Dealing with Death
We all must face the truth and finality of death. That one day we will die. Eventually even the universe will come to an end. This will remove all traces of our existence. Even Shakespeare and Beethoven will be forgotten. This existential anxst leads many people to become depressed and to live an apathetic, passive existence. Some say: "Everything is pointless. Why should I do anything when it will all come to an end? Death makes life meaningless". Others seek religion as a bastion against the darkness.

But you don't have to look at the truth of death so despairingly.

I think there is a better way:

**The shortness of life makes every moment valuable.**

The truth of death means that this experience of life is all that you have. And soon it will come to an end. Anything scarce is inherently valuable. Why not try to make the best of every moment? 

Life is also incredibly perilous. Most of us in the developed world expect to live 80 years or more. But that is not for certain. You never know what life has in store. It's not something you can control, and maybe you'll just be unlucky. Surely this is even more reason to value what you have: the opportunity to experience things now. In the present! 

What is certain is that you will never be able to live today again.

Nobody knows or I think will ever know the truth of existence: why we are here? But for some reason we've been given this time. And evolution has blessed us with depths of emotion and the ability to do so many things. Why not take advantage of that? 

You're can respond to the existential problem in two ways. Either you can be angry at the universe for something that you can't control (that you will die). Or you can try and make the best use of what you can control: how ever much time you have left. Fill your life with excitement, love and joy!

## What's a Flower?
So as there are two ways to look at the fact you will die, I think there are also two ways to look at the world. Take a flower.

The probability of your existence is infinitesimally small. It is a miracle that you are able to exist and experience the world. Even the probability that your particular sperm fertilized the egg is millions to ones. Then there is the probability that your parents met. That your line did not die out generations ago. Then there is the probability of humanity emerging in the first place. The Earth had to be water based, it had to be the right distance from the Sun. It had to have an atmosphere. But even more amazing is the miraculously unexplainable universe. For whatever reason, god or no god, that it exists, it¡¯s just incredible. 

How can you worry that you only have 80 years when you realise how lucky you are to have anything?

The knowledge of the miracle of your existence, should make you want to reach out and grab life with everything you've got. 

300 generations of homo sapiens needed to find love. Even barmy uncle Johnny with the gammy leg and the micro penis. He still managed to fucking copulate.

## Boundless Possibilities
Another thing that blows my mind is the countless possibilities that are open to us as human beings in the 21st century. When you open your eyes to the world you realise there is so much opportunity to DO things. There are lifetimes of things to learn, music to listen to, films to watch, places to visit, sports to try and unique people to meet. 

For some time after I had accepted this idea of the value of life and the boundless possibilities open to us it actually made me more anxious! Because if our time is truly valuable then the importance of every decision is maximised. And researches have long documented the negative effects of too many options. (see my notes or article on The Paradox of Choice). These two things combine together to make the mother of all anxieties! You basically say to yourself: "I have to choose the best option from the thousands of possibilities open to me. And if I make a mistake then I have wasted a moment of the most valuable thing: my time".

Firstly, you can think of all your mistakes as opportunities to learn. Which will allow you to make better decisions in the future. When a failure presents itself; again there is a choice. Either to be disappointed and unhappy because you didn't get what you wanted. Or to be happy for the opportunity to improve and do better next time.

Secondly, and more importantly, I think the comparison between options, "The Premier League Table of Experiences" is a lie. There is a growing fetishisation of experiences in our society. Your day was only worthwhile if you "did" things. You went to a fancy restaurant, ran a marathon or saw something incredible. If you look at the [[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying][regrets of the dying]], they're not that they never climbed Kilimanjaro but things most of us think are simple like friendship, family and time to take in the world. This Vonnegut quote sums this up perfectly.

>"Enjoy the little things in life because one day you'll look back and realize they were the big things." - Kurt Vonnegut

## The Conclusion
Like the Dylan Thomas poem "Don't go gentle into that good night". We don't have much time. So however old you are, now is the time to grow, learn, dream and fall in love with people and life.
